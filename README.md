BBC News Labs - Google Glass App

Our Google Glass sample app lets you request the latest news about any topic from the BBC.

You can swipe to move past stories and hear a breif audio description of the story.

Note: You will need a Google Glass and SDK to to be able to install and use this app.

How to use it:

* Say "Show me the news"
* It will ask what you would like to hear news about
* Say "MH17"
* You'll get back the latest news on the MH17 story

You can query for anything, and it will use the Juicer from BBC News Labs using the Juicer API.
